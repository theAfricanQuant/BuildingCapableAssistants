    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on enhancing large language models (LLMs) to become more reliable and capable assistants by integrating tools, improving information accuracy, and expanding their functionality. Key topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tool Integration**: LLMs can be augmented with tools to access real-time data, perform specific tasks (e.g., web searches, database queries), and overcome limitations in domain-specific or up-to-date knowledge.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Research Assistant Application**: An example application demonstrates how connecting external data sources improves LLM performance by grounding responses in factual, current information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Extraction**: Techniques for extracting structured information from unstructured documents are explored, enabling LLMs to better process and analyze complex data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fact-Checking**: Methods to mitigate hallucinations and inaccuracies in LLM outputs are discussed, including automatic fact-checking against evidence to ensure correctness and reduce misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Reasoning Strategies**: Advanced reasoning approaches are applied to further enhance the capabilities of LLMs in solving complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section explores how tools can enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by addressing their limitations, particularly in areas like complex calculations or accessing external data. Below is a concise summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points on Tool Use:\n",
    "1. **Tool Integration**:\n",
    "   - LLMs struggle with tasks requiring precise computations or logical reasoning, where specialized tools (e.g., calculators) excel.\n",
    "   - Combining LLMs with tools improves their problem-solving abilities and enables them to perform exact computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tool Components**:\n",
    "   - **Name**: A unique identifier for the tool within an agent's toolkit.\n",
    "   - **Function**: The executable logic or action the tool performs.\n",
    "   - **Description**: A textual explanation that helps the LLM (agent) select the appropriate tool for a task.\n",
    "   - **Args Schema**: An optional Pydantic BaseModel schema that provides parameter validation and examples for inputs.\n",
    "   - **Return Direct Flag**: Indicates whether the tool's result should be returned directly to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Example: WikipediaQueryRun Tool**:\n",
    "   - Demonstrates the use of a built-in LangChain tool, `WikipediaQueryRun`, which wraps around Wikipedia for querying general knowledge.\n",
    "   - Initialization involves configuring parameters like `top_k_results` and `doc_content_chars_max`.\n",
    "   - The tool's attributes (`name`, `description`, `args`, `return_direct`) provide clarity on its purpose and usage.\n",
    "   - It can be invoked with either a dictionary input or a simple string query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Tools**:\n",
    "   - While LangChain offers many pre-built tools, creating custom tools allows for tailored functionality and deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics.\n"

    "## Defining custom tools\n",
    "To define custom tools in LangChain, you can follow approaches such as these:\n",
    "\n",
    "@tool decorator\n",
    "Subclassing BaseTool\n",
    "StructuredTool dataclass\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces the concept of using Python's **decorator syntax** to define tools in a more concise and intuitive way. Below is a summary of how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points on Tool Decorators:\n",
    "1. **Decorator Syntax**:\n",
    "   - Tools can be defined using Python decorators, which simplify the process of creating tools.\n",
    "   - The `@tool` decorator is used to mark a function as a tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Default Behavior**:\n",
    "   - By default, the decorator uses the function's name as the tool's name.\n",
    "   - The function's docstring serves as the tool's description, making it mandatory to include a clear and descriptive docstring.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advantages**:\n",
    "   - Simplifies the creation of tools by embedding the tool's logic directly within a function.\n",
    "   - Encourages clarity through the use of docstrings, ensuring that the tool's purpose is well-documented.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example above, we define a `CalculatorInput` class to specify the expected input format—two integers. This class ensures proper type validation using Pydantic. The `multiply` function then utilizes this schema to enforce type safety.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also set `return_direct=True`, which allows the function’s output to be returned immediately without additional processing. Finally, we call the `run` method with a dictionary containing values for `a` and `b`, executing the multiplication operation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While `StructuredTool` simplifies tool creation, handling potential errors during execution is essential. The next section will explore strategies for implementing error-handling mechanisms in LangChain tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We Used `pydantic.v1`  \n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain was originally built with **Pydantic v1**, but recent versions of Pydantic introduced breaking changes in v2. Some parts of LangChain **still expect Pydantic v1-style schemas**, which led to validation errors when using `pydantic` v2 directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain compatibility, we explicitly imported from `pydantic.v1`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic.v1 import BaseModel, Field\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that LangChain functions correctly interpret the input schema and avoid validation errors when using `StructuredTool`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As LangChain continues evolving, future versions may fully support Pydantic v2, eliminating the need for this workaround. Until then, using `pydantic.v1` remains the most reliable solution for structured tool definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error handling\n",
    "Additionally, LangChain provides a way to handle tool errors. When a tool encounters an error and the exception is not caught, the agent will stop executing. To allow the agent to continue execution, you can raise a ToolException and set handle_tool_error accordingly:"

    "\n",
    "   - `chain = load_agent()`: Initializes the agent executor by calling the `load_agent()` function.\n",
    "   - `if prompt := st.chat_input():`: Checks if the user has provided input in the Streamlit chat interface.\n",
    "   - `st.chat_message(\"user\").write(prompt)`: If there is user input, display it in the chat as a user message.\n",
    "   - `with st.chat_message(\"assistant\"):`: Sets the context for the assistant's response in the chat.\n",
    "   - `st_callback = StreamlitCallbackHandler(st.container())`: Creates a `StreamlitCallbackHandler` to integrate the agent's intermediate steps (thoughts, actions, observations) with the Streamlit application, allowing for a more interactive display of the agent's reasoning process.\n",
    "   - `response = chain.invoke(...)`: Invokes the agent (using the `AgentExecutor`) with the user's prompt and additional parameters:\n",
    "     - `{\"input\": prompt}`: Provides the user's input as a dictionary with the key \"input.\"\n",
    "     - `callbacks=[st_callback]`: Includes the Streamlit callback handler to display the agent's thinking process.\n",
    "     - `handle_parsing_errors=True`: Enables error handling to allow the agent to recover from potential parsing errors during its response generation.\n",
    "   - `print(f\"Response: {response}\")`: Prints the complete response dictionary for debugging and inspection.\n",
    "   - `if \"agent_outcome\" in response and response[\"agent_outcome\"] is not None:`: Checks if the response dictionary contains information about the agent's outcome and prints it if available.\n",
    "   - `st.write(response[\"output\"])`: Extracts the final answer or output generated by the agent and displays it in the Streamlit chat interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "This code sets up a Streamlit-based chatbot application that utilizes a ReAct agent powered by a large language model. The agent can access external tools like arXiv and Wikipedia to gather information and provide comprehensive responses. The use of a prompt template enforces a clear and structured response format, while the Streamlit callback handler provides insights into the agent's reasoning process. The application is designed to be interactive, allowing users to engage in a conversation with the agent and receive informative answers to their questions."
